# GPU Development in Tercen Studio

GPU support is now available in **Tercen Studio**. Follow the steps below to enable and test GPU access in your local setup.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Pull the latest version** of the Tercen Studio repository:  
   [https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio](https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio)

2. **Uncomment GPU-related configuration** in `docker-compose.yaml`.

Under the `dind` service:
```yaml
image: tercen/nvidia-dind:12.1.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          count: 1
          capabilities: [ gpu ]
```

Under the VS Code service:
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          count: 1
          capabilities: [ gpu ]
```

Once the containers are up, you should be able to access the GPU from **Code Server**.

## Changes to operators

- The `Dockerfile` uses a GPU-enabled runtime:

```Dockerfile
FROM tercen/runtime-tf:2.17.0-gpu
```

- The `operator.json` declares GPU capability:

```json
"capabilities": ["gpu"]
```

## Verifying GPU Access

Once inside the container, verify GPU access using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### TensorFlow
```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available:", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

### PyTorch
```python
import torch
print("Is CUDA available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If GPU is not detected, you might need to install some drivers and dependencies on your machine. Please refer to Dockerâ€™s GPU support documentation:
