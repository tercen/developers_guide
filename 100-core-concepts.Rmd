# Core concepts

So you want to build an app, or just plain curious. The first question to ask 
oneself is which type of Tercen app would you like to build. There are 
three main types:

* __Templates__
* __Workflows__
* __Operators__

A researcher wanting a complete workflow data analysis (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto,
etc.) chooses one of the workflows expressed as a list of __template__. A 
__template__ therefore represents the highest level app because it defines a 
set of many steps in sequence to achieve the complete analysis. There would be
a __template__ for each of the high-level workflow (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.).

A researcher wanting a specific statistical process (e.g. quality control, two 
group analysis, or enrichment analysis, etc.) chooses from a list of __apps__. 
A __app__ therefore represents the second highest level app because it defines a
focused set of steps and visuals to achieve one particular statistical objective.


A researcher wanting a specific operator function (e.g. scale, log, multiplication,
addition and subtraction, etc.) chooses from a list of __operators__. 
An __operator__ therefore represents a single computational step. It is a 
typically a single R or Python function.


In summary a researcher wishing a full end-to-end workflow chooses a __template__, 
a specific data process chooses a __workflow__, a specific computation chooses 
an __operator__.

Once an app is built, it may be added to the __app library__ where it can be 
accessed by researchers.


Deciding on which to build is determined by what you would like the app to achieve.
The first two, __template__ and __workflow__, do not need programming experience, 
the __operator__ does. 


The building of each app is explained in the following chapters.

## Template app {-}

No programming knowledge is required to build a template app.
These are built by using the Tercen user interface and deployed within Tercen 

## Workflow app {-}

No programming knowledge is required to build a workflow app.
These are built by using the Tercen user interface and deployed within Tercen 

## Operator app {-}

Programming knowledge is required to build an __operator__ using any number of 
programming languages (R, Python, Rust, etc.). The code is put on Github 
for the __app library__ to find. 

Currently Tercen has made a convenient R package for working with the Tercen API,
we aim to quickly cater for the other programming languages (Python, Matlab etc.) 
during our final release.

A command line function can also be deployed as an __operator app__. This is 
done using a docker concept.
