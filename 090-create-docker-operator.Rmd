# Creating a docker operator app

Some R packages require additional system libraries that might not be installed in the Tercen environment. We can install them locally, but a problem persists:

**How to tell Tercen to install these dependencies when installing an operator?**

A solution is to create a **docker container** with our environment. If you are not familiar with Docker, it is highly recommended that you read the [Get started with Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

## Create the R operator locally {-}

As an example, we will use the [worldmap Tercen operator](https://github.com/tercen/shiny_worldmap_operator). It requires the R package `sf`, commonly used to plot maps. This package requires an external system dependency, `GDAL`, depending itself on `UDUNIT2`.

You will not be able to install this R package if you don't have these dependencies installed on the system. To install the package in Tercen Studio, we simply need to run this command in the terminal:

```bash
apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev
```
Once the operator is running locally (see section [Running docker operators locally]), we can prepare the docker operator.

## Create the docker operator {-}

First, create a second GitHub repository that will hold the code used to build the image:

* A template for a Shiny Docker operator can be found here: https://github.com/tercen/shiny_docker_operator

* The worldmap docker operator can be found here: https://github.com/tercen/shiny_worldmap_docker_operator

It contains different files:

*	`Dockerfile`: instructions to build the Docker container 

* `README.md`: to document the operator

* `operator.json`:

* `start.R`: internal, should not be modified.

For the worldmap operator, the `Dockerfile` look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM tercen/dartrusttidy:1.0.7

USER root
WORKDIR /operator

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y libudunits2-dev
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y libgdal-dev

RUN git clone https://github.com/tercen/shiny_worldmap_operator.git

WORKDIR /operator/shiny_worldmap_operator

RUN echo 0.0.5 && git pull
RUN git checkout 0.0.5

RUN R -e "renv::restore(confirm=FALSE)"

ENV TERCEN_SERVICE_URI https://tercen.com

COPY start.R /start.R

ENTRYPOINT [ "R","--no-save","--no-restore","--no-environ","--slave","-f","/start.R"]
```

From the template, we need to:

* indicate the git repository containing the R operator (here,  `https://github.com/tercen/shiny_worldmap_operator.git`)

* modify the working directory (`/operator/shiny_worldmap_operator`, based on the GitHub repository name)

* modify the tag (here, `0.0.5`)

* add the commands to install our dependencies:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y libudunits2-dev
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y libgdal-dev
```

Finally, we need to modify the `operator.json` docker operator file.

```json
{
  "name": "Worldmap",
  "description": "Shiny world map representation",
  "tags": ["map"],
  "authors": ["tercen"],
  "urls": ["https://github.com/tercen/shiny_worldmap_docker_operator"],
  "container": "agouy/worldmap:0.0.5",
  "isWebApp": true
}
```

Pay attention to the two following lines:

* `"container": "agouy/worldmap:0.0.5"` is used to indicate the account, name and tag of the docker container,

* `"isWebApp": true` as we are handling a Shiny app.


## Build and push docker image {-}

* If you do not already have one, create an account on Docker Hub.

* Install Docker on your machine: [How to install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

* Login to Docker Hub using the `docker login` command and your credentials.  [Refer to the docker login docs for a complete reference]

```bash
docker login --username=YOURUSERNAME --password=YOURPASSWORD
```

* Build your image with the `docker build` command (with ACCOUNT your account name, REPO your image name and TAG your tag)

```bash
docker build -t $ACCOUNT/$REPO:$TAG .
```

* Finally, push the image to your hub.

```bash
sudo docker push $ACCOUNT/$REPO:$TAG
```

## Running docker operators locally {-}

If you wish to test your docker operator in your local __Tercen__, you require to activate the docker capability in __Tercen Studio__ by changing the `docker-compose.yaml` file of your __Tercen Studio__ setup.

Please check the `docker-compose.yaml` file, it is found in main installation folder of __Tercen Studio__.

The steps to modify the file are:

First stop the dockers:

`docker-compose down`

Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file, read the comments within the file, there a set of lines which require to be uncommented. The are by default commented out:

```
#    environment:
#      - tercen.log.level="0"
# needed for docker operators, 172.17.0.1 is the default docker gateway
#      - tercen.public.client.uri=http://172.17.0.1:5402
#      - tercen.worker.public.ip=172.17.0.1
```

The above is an example to activate on an Ubuntu system, the settings may differ for windows, please check with `support@tercen.com`.

After you have saved the file, then start the dockers.

`docker-compose up -d`

These modification allow __Tercen Studio__ to run operators which are using dockers.

## Integrating any code (e.g. C++)  {-}

If your algorithm code is not in R. Then consider the following example, it highlights an operator which is written in C++ called `atsne` or approximate tsne.

It is implemented in Tercen using two concepts, one an operator and one a docker.

* an [atsne_operator](https://github.com/tercen/atsne_operator)
* an [atsne_docker](https://github.com/tercen/atsne_docker_operator)

The `atsne_operator` calls the C++ code implemented in the `atsne_docker`.

Please check out the repository (click on links above) and see how this it was configured.
