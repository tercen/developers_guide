# Next steps

Here are some ideas:

* Try to code for different operators using the ``teRcen`` R package, Note when 
using R Studio it will auto-complete when you type the methods on the Tercen 
client and tercen query object.
* Give feedback on this developer's guide by creating an [issue](https://github.com/tercen/appbuilders-guide/issues)
* Give feedback on __Tercen__ by sending an email to `support@tercen.com`
* Contact us for a one-2-one session
