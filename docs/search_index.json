Why read this guide? : Your curious or wish to build an app for Tercen then this is the guide. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],
["apps-types.html", "Chapter 1 Apps types", " Chapter 1 Apps types So you want to build an app, or just plain curious. The first question to ask oneself is which type of Tercen app would you like to build. There are three main types: Template app Workflow app Operator app A researcher wanting a complete workflow data analysis (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.) chooses one of the workflows expressed as a list of template apps. A template app therefore represents the highest level app because it defines a set of many steps in sequence to achieve the complete analysis. There would be a template app for each of the high-level workflow (e.g. RNA-seq, flow cyto, etc.). A researcher wanting a specific statistical process (e.g. quality control, two group analysis, or enrichment analysis, etc.) chooses from a list of workflow apps. A workflow app therefore represents the second highest level app because it defines a focused set of steps and visuals to achieve one particular statistical objective. A researcher wanting a specific operator function (e.g. scale, log, multiplication, addition and subtraction, etc.) chooses from a list of operator apps. An Operator app therefore represents a single computational step. In summary a research wishing a full end-to-end workflow chooses a template app, a specific data process chooses a workflow app, a specific computation chooses an operator app. Once an app is built, it may be added to the app-library where it can be accessed by researchers. Deciding on which to build is determined by what you would like the app to achieve. The first two, template and workflow, do not need programming experience, the operator does. Each has its own building process. Workflows and template apps are built and deployed within Tercen while an operator app is written using any number of programming languages (R, Python, Rust, etc.). The code is put on git hub for the app library to find. Currently Tercen has made a convenient R package for working with the Tercen API, we aim to quickly cover the other languages during our final release. The building of each app is explained in the following chapters. "],
["setting-up-tercen-studio.html", "Chapter 2 Setting up tercen-studio Installing tercen-studio Starting tercen-studio", " Chapter 2 Setting up tercen-studio If you wish to develop operators then you require to have a programming development environment. If you are a regular programmer then you already have your environment. For templates and workflow apps you do not need a development environment as Tercen contains all the features required to build them. Installing tercen-studio 1. Install docker-compose First you need to install docker-compose. For Windows: If you use Windows, you can install Docker-Desktop for Windows that includes docker-compose. Important: Make sure the Enable Hyper-V Windows Features option is selected on the Configuration page. Then, you need to activate shared drives: Right click on the running docker service and select “Settings” &gt; “Shared drives” Share the tercen_studio folder For Mac and Linux: Check out how to install docker-compose on Mac or Linux. 2. Clone tercen-studio repository Then, get tercen-studio by cloning the following repository: git clone https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio.git cd tercen_studio Starting tercen-studio Once docker-compose is installed and the tercen-studio repository cloned, you can start tercen by running: docker-compose up -d You can run Tercen by going to http://127.0.0.1:5402.

["building-an-operator-app-general-procedure.html", "Chapter 5 Building an operator app: general procedure Design the operator Set up a project from a template Code and test locally Deploy!", " Chapter 5 Building an operator app: general procedure Here we will learn through a concrete example how to create an R operator for Tercen. Our goal is to create an operator performing a linear regression on our input data and returning the slope and intercept of the model. Design the operator The first step is to define our input projection and output relation. In Tercen, each operator shall take as input a table and return a table. Remember: “Table in, table out!” The operator model can be seen as follow: Set up a project from a template 1. Create a GitHub repository from a template Create a new GitHub repository with your own account based on a Tercen operator template that you can find on GitHub (https://github.com/tercen/). Then you can create your own repository based on this template. Choose an explicit name. Now that the repository is initiated in your GitHub account, you can work on it locally, using tercen-studio for example. 2. Set up the Tercen input projection Start Tercen locally and set up the desired projection with a data step. Note that the data step URL includes this pattern: /w/WORKFLOWID/ds/DATASTEPID, where WORKFLOWID and DATASTEPID are unique workflow and data step identifiers, respectively. These identifiers will be used in the next step to get data from this data step. Code and test locally Now that our RStudio project and Tercen projection are set up, we can code and test our operator locally. Using tercen-studio, code your operator Execute the code and check the results in Tercen using the data step and workflow IDs taken from the Tercen data step URL Deploy! Once you are satisfied with your operator, you can release it. Document the operator Edit the README.md to describe the operator design and usage. The documentation should contain: A general description of the operator A description of the input projections A description of the output relations Prepare operator testing It’s always good to prepare some unit tests that could be ran when a new version of Tercen is released. To include a test, you need to create a test subdirectory in your project directory. It must include: a test input file an expected output file a JSON file containing information about the test Initiate package version control The ability to run an operator with exactly the same packages you used when you developed is essential for reproducible science. In order to ensure reproducibility, you can associate packages and their versions to your operator by initiating a project-local environment with a private libraries in a subdirectory. Push it to your GitHub repository Once everything is ready, you simply need to push all the modifications to the GitHub repository that you created before. If you want to install it directly from Tercen, you will need to create a release in GitHub. All the operators apps are version controlled. All operator apps who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen. 4. Notify community Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the operators app git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the app-library and thus allowing others to access it.

["creating-an-r-operator-app-walkthrough-example.html", "Chapter 6 Creating an R operator app: walkthrough example Designing the operator Setting up the project Coding and testing the operator locally", " Chapter 6 Creating an R operator app: walkthrough example Here we will learn through a concrete example how to create an R operator for Tercen. Our goal is to create an operator performing a linear regression on our input data and returning the slope and intercept of the model. Designing the operator The first step is to define our input projection and output relation. In Tercen, each operator shall take as input a table and return a table. Remember: “Table in, table out!” Here we want to perform the linear regression of the values projected on the y axis against the values projected on the x axis, per cell. In this example, we will output only the intercept and the slope of the model, per cell. The operator model can be seen as follow: Setting up the project Make sure that tercen-studio is properly set up and that both Tercen and RStudio run locally (respectively on http://127.0.0.1:5402 and http://127.0.0.1:8787/). Otherwise, please refer to Chapter 2. 1. Create a GitHub repository from a template Create a new GitHub repository with your own account based on the Tercen R operator template (https://github.com/tercen/templateR_operator). Click on the green button Use this template in the Tercen template repository. Then you can create your own repository based on this template. Choose an explicit name (here, lm_operator). Now that the repository is initiated in your GitHub account, go back to RStudio Server (http://127.0.0.1:8787/). Create a new project by clicking on File &gt; New project &gt; Version control &gt; Git. You will be asked the URL of the repository (put the newly created one) and a name for the project. Now, your local project should include the skeleton: main.R: main operator script workspace.R: local testing script operator.json: operator metadata README_template.md: operator documentation template doc directory: includes a dev_commands.md file, which contains useful development command lines. 2. Set up the Tercen input projection In this example, We will use the khan dataset (available on https://github.com/tercen/khan_data). First, we start Tercen locally (http://127.0.0.1:5402) and set up a pairwise projection of the measurement in different tissues. The data step of interest should look as follow: Note that the data step URL includes this pattern: /w/WORKFLOWID/ds/DATASTEPID, where WORKFLOWID and DATASTEPID are unique workflow and data step identifiers, respectively. These identifiers will be used in the next step within RStudio to get data from this data step. Coding and testing the operator locally Now that our RStudio project and Tercen projection are set up, we can code and test our operator locally as follow: Open workspace.R Replace the data step and workflow IDs taken from the Tercen data step URL in workspace.R: library(tercen) library(dplyr) options(&quot;tercen.workflowId&quot; = &quot;WORKFLOWID&quot;) options(&quot;tercen.stepId&quot; = &quot;DATASTEPID&quot;) Code your operator. Here, we implement a function do.lm() that performs a linear regression on the input data frame and return the slope and intercept of the model. do.lm &lt;- function(df) { out &lt;- data.frame( .ri = df$.ri[1], .ci = df$.ci[1], intercept = NaN, slope = NaN ) mod &lt;- try(lm(.y ~ .x, data = df)) if(!inherits(mod, &#39;try-error&#39;)) { out$intercept &lt;- mod$coefficients[1] out$slope &lt;- mod$coefficients[2] } return(out) } ctx &lt;- tercenCtx() %&gt;% # Get data from the data step select(.x, .y, .ri, .ci) %&gt;% # select variables of interest group_by(.ri, .ci) %&gt;% # group by row and column (&quot;per cell&quot;) do(do.lm(.)) %&gt;% # do the linear model ctx$addNamespace() %&gt;% # add namespace ctx$save() # push results back to Tercen using the API Execute the code and check the results in Tercen Note that we recommend to implement the following sanity checks when creating an operator: check the presence of expected inputs (here, x and y axes) use the try() function to test the main function implemented (here, lm()) "],
["deploying-an-r-operator-app-walkthrough-example.html", "Chapter 7 Deploying an R operator app: walkthrough example Documenting the operator Preparing operator testing Deploy!", " Chapter 7 Deploying an R operator app: walkthrough example Now that we have a working R operator for Tercen, we want to deploy it! We will now document, prepare tests and release our linear regression operator. Documenting the operator Edit the README.md to describe the operator design and usage. The documentation should contain: A general description of the operator A description of the input projections A description of the output relations For example, here is how the lm operator documentation looks: Description The lm operator performs a linear regression in Tercen. Usage Input projection y-axis measurement value x-axis explanatory value Output relations intercept numeric, intercept of the linear regression, per cell slope numeric, slope of the linear regression, per cell Details The lm operator performs a linear regression on each cell and returns the slope and intercept of the model. Preparing operator testing It’s always good to prepare some tests that could be ran when a new version of Tercen is released. To include a test, you need to create a test subdirectory in your project directory. It must include: a test input file an expected output file a JSON file containing information about the test For example, a test for our lm operator can be created as follow: # Simulate tercen input based on the CO2 dataset # with an x and y-axis, rows and columns data(CO2) df &lt;- data.frame(.x = CO2$conc, .y = CO2$uptake, .ri = CO2$Plant, .ci = CO2$Treatment) # Run the do.lm() function created above to generate the expected output out &lt;- df %&gt;% select(.ci, .ri, .x, .y) %&gt;% group_by(.ri, .ci) %&gt;% do(do.lm(.)) # write input and expected output in the test subdirectory write.csv(CO2, file=&quot;./test/CO2.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE) write.csv(out, file=&quot;./test/output.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE) Now that we have our input and ouput files, we can create the JSON file that shall include the following information: { &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;OperatorUnitTest&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;testlm1&quot;, &quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;test&quot;, &quot;inputDataUri&quot;: &quot;CO2.csv&quot;, &quot;outputDataUri&quot;: [&quot;output.csv&quot;], &quot;columns&quot;: [&quot;Treatment&quot;], &quot;rows&quot;: [&quot;Plant&quot;], &quot;colors&quot;: [], &quot;labels&quot;: [], &quot;yAxis&quot;: &quot;uptake&quot;, &quot;xAxis&quot;: &quot;conc&quot; } The name attribute is free. Input and output test files names must be assigned to the inputDataUri and inputDataUri, respectively. Variable names of the input file must be assigned to the columns, rows, colors, labels, yAxis, xAxis attributes. In our case, colors and labels are left empty as they are not part of our input. Deploy! 1. Copy the code to the main.R script Once you are confident enough that your operator is working after testing it locally, you can copy the code to the main.R file. Make sure not to include the options() calls that are only needed during the local development step: # The following lines shall not be included into main.R: options(&quot;tercen.workflowId&quot; = &quot;wwww&quot;) options(&quot;tercen.stepId&quot; = &quot;dddd&quot;) getOption(&quot;tercen.workflowId&quot;) getOption(&quot;tercen.stepId&quot;) 2. Initiate renv The ability to run an operator with exactly the same packages you used when you developed is essential for reproducible science. In order to ensure reproducibility, you can associate packages and their versions to your operator by using the init() function of the renv package: renv::init() This will initiate a project-local environment with a private R library in the renv subdirectory. 3. Push it to your GitHub repository Once everything is ready, you simply need to push all the modifications to the GitHub repository that you created before. If you want to install it directly from Tercen, you will need to create a release in GitHub. 4.
