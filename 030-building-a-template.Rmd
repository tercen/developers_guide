# Building a template app

The process for building a __template app__ is:

* Design the __template__
* Create a workflow in Tercen
* Set the properties of the workflow to __template__
* Test it on input data
* Notify the community of its existence (see below)

All the building and deployment steps are performed in Tercen.

All __template apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.

## Notify the community {-}

Currently, we ask you to send an email to <support@tercen.com> containing the description and link to the workflow git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building a web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
