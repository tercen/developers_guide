# Next steps
Here are some ideas:

* Try to code for different operators using the ``teRcen`` R package, Note when using RStudio it will autocomplete when you type the methods on the tercen client and tercen query object.
* Give feedback on this app builder's guide by creating an [issue](https://github.com/tercen/appbuilders-guide/issues)
* Read the online [__Tercen Book__](https://tercen.github.io/tercen-book/)
* Give feedback on __Tercen__ by sending an email to `info@tercen.com`
* Contact us for a one-2-one session
