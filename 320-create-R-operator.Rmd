# Walkthrough example: R operator

Here we will learn through a concrete example how to create an R operator for Tercen. Our goal is to create an operator performing a __linear regression__ on our input data and returning the slope and intercept of the model.

## Designing the operator {-}

The first step is to define our __input projection__ and __output relation__. In Tercen, each operator shall take as input a table and return a table. Remember:

> "__Table in, table out!__"

Here we want to perform the linear regression of the values __projected on the y axis__ against the values __projected on the x axis__, __per cell__. In this example, we will output only the intercept and the slope of the model, __per cell__. The operator model can be seen as follow:

## Setting up the project {-}

Make sure that `tercen-studio` is properly set up and that both `Tercen` and `RStudio` run locally (respectively on http://127.0.0.1:5402 and http://127.0.0.1:8787/). Otherwise, please refer to __Chapter 2__.

**1. Create a GitHub repository from a template**

__Create a new GitHub repository__ with your own account based on the Tercen R operator template (https://github.com/tercen/templateR_operator). Click on the green button __Use this template__ in the Tercen template repository.

<center><img src="./images/R_operator_example_SETUP2.png" width=1000></img></center>

Then you can create your own repository based on this template. Choose an explicit name (here, `lm_operator`).

Now that the repository is initiated in your GitHub account, __go back to RStudio Server__ (http://127.0.0.1:8787/). __Create a new project__ by clicking on File > New project > Version control > Git. 

You will be asked the URL of the repository (put the newly created one) and a name for the project. Now, your local project should include the skeleton:

* `main.R`: main operator script

* `workspace.R`: local testing script

* `operator.json`: operator metadata

* `README_template.md`: operator documentation template

* `doc` directory: includes a `dev_commands.md` file, which contains useful development command lines.


**2. Set up the Tercen input projection**

In this example, We will use the khan dataset (available on https://github.com/tercen/khan_data). First, we start Tercen locally (http://127.0.0.1:5402) and set up a pairwise projection of the measurement in different tissues. The data step of interest should look as follow:

<center><img src="./images/R_operator_example_DATASTEP.png" width=700></img></center>

Note that the data step URL includes this pattern: `/w/WORKF+LOWID/ds/DATASTEPID`, where `WORKFLOWID` and `DATASTEPID` are __unique workflow and data step identifiers__, respectively. These identifiers will be used in the next step within RStudio to get data from this data step.

## Develope the operator locally {-}

Now that our RStudio project and Tercen projection are set up, we can code and test our operator locally as follow:

* Open `workspace.R`

* Replace the data step and workflow IDs taken from the Tercen data step URL in `workspace.R`:

```r
library(tercen)
library(dplyr)

options("tercen.workflowId" = "WORKFLOWID")
options("tercen.stepId"     = "DATASTEPID")
```

* Code your operator. Here, we implement a function `do.lm()` that performs a linear regression on the input data frame and return the slope and intercept of the model.

```r
do.lm <- function(df) {
  out <- data.frame(
    .ri = df$.ri[1],
    .ci = df$.ci[1],
    intercept = NaN,
    slope = NaN
  )
  
  mod <- lm(.y ~ .x, data = df)
  
  out$intercept <- mod$coefficients[1]
  out$slope <- mod$coefficients[2]
  
  return(out)
}

ctx <- tercenCtx()  %>%          # Get data from the data step
  select(.x, .y, .ri, .ci) %>%   # select variables of interest
  group_by(.ri, .ci) %>%         # group by row and column ("per cell")
  do(do.lm(.)) %>%               # do the linear model
  ctx$addNamespace() %>%         # add namespace
  ctx$save()                     # push results back to Tercen using the API
```

* __Execute the code__ and __check the results__ in Tercen

Note that we recommend to implement the following __sanity checks__ when creating an operator:

* check the presence of __expected inputs__ (here, x and y axes)

* use the __`try()` function__ to test the main function implemented (here, `lm()`)
