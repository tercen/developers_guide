# Building an app

## The app concept 

An __app__ is perfect for users who wish tot have a focused module of analysis
with multiple operators and views (e.g. PCA).

The building of an __app__ does not require any programming.

## Creating an app

The process for building an app is:

* Design the __app__
* Create a __app__ in Tercen
* Insert Wizard step (optional)
* Replace the initial Table step with Input step
* Add a final Output step
* Save it
* Create an app folder in the project area
* Move the workflow to this app folder
* Test it in a workflow with data
* Download the workflow
* Create a github repository
* Upload the app
* Tag the repository
* Notify the community of its existence (see below)

All the building and deployment processes are performed in Tercen.

All __apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and 
a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.
