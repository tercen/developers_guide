# Common development issues

## Where can I find my Tercen token?

You can find your Tercen token by logging into your instance and navigating to:

`https://YOUR_INSTANCE_URL/_token`

For example:
- If you work on tercen.com, go to: `https://tercen.com/_token`
- If you work on a custom instance, replace `YOUR_INSTANCE_URL` with your actual domain

The token will be displayed on this page and can be copied for use in your development environment.

## Failed to decode

```
tercen.http.HttpClientService.TercenError: unknown : failed to decode
```

When running the `TercenContext()` function in Python (or `tercenCtx()` in R), this error happens when it is not possible to retrieve data from the specified data step. Common underlying reasons include:
* Data Step has not been saved
* Data Step is already run

In order to fix the issue:
* Reset the data step,
* Save - Refresh - Save the data step,
* Re-run the TercenContext call.
