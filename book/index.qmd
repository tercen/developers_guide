Welcome to the Tercen Developer's Guide! This comprehensive resource will help you design, develop, and share **modules** for the **Tercen** platform.

## What is Tercen?

Tercen is a collaborative data analysis platform that bridges the gap between data scientists and domain experts. It enables seamless collaboration by allowing:

- **Domain experts** (e.g., biologists, researchers) to explore and analyze their data using intuitive visual interfaces
- **Developers** (e.g., bioinformaticians, data scientists) to create and share reusable analytical tools and web applications

## Our Mission

Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis because not everyone can codeâ€”nor should they need to. Everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and computational tools currently available.

By connecting non-programmers with programmers, Tercen creates a powerful ecosystem where:

- **Biologists** gain direct access to sophisticated analytical tools without needing programming expertise
- **Bioinformaticians** can focus on algorithm development rather than operational details and repetitive analysis requests

This symbiotic relationship empowers both communities and democratizes data analysis.

> Tercen **empowers** the biologist and **liberates** the bioinformatician.

## What You'll Learn
