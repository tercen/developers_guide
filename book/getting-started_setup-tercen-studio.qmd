# Setting up Tercen Studio

If you wish to develop __operators__ then you need to set up a development environment.

## Installing Tercen Studio {-}

**1. Install docker-compose**

First you need to install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). 

**For Windows:**

If you use Windows, you can install [Docker-Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) that includes `docker-compose`.

**Advise**: Select the __WSL 2 backend__ system option when installing on Windows.


**For Mac and Linux:**

Check out [how to install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on Mac or Linux.

**2. Clone tercen-studio repository**

Then, __get tercen-studio__ by cloning the following repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio.git
cd tercen_studio
```

You then need to create the `tercen` network by running the following command.

```
docker network create tercen
```

The latest instructions on how to install Tercen Studio can be found in the 
README of the [Tercen Studio GitHub repository](https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio).

```bash
docker-compose up -d
