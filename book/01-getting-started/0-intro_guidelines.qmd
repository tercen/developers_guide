# Guidelines

## Introduction {-}

We want developers to have a great experience building on the Tercen Platform. Building a vibrant developer ecosystem benefits everyone and helps make data analysis accessible to a wider community.

These guidelines show you how to use Tercen's products, services, and APIs effectively, sharing best practices for building new products and services.

While we need some rules of engagement, we've kept these guidelines as simple as possible. These guidelines work alongside our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/tercen/Policy/blob/main/terms-of-service.md) and [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/tercen/Policy/blob/main/Privacy.md). Please read and understand these documents. We reserve the right to withdraw access if our products or services are misused.

## Legal text {-}

Before starting work, we'll ask you to confirm that you're happy to comply with 
the spirit and the letter of these guidelines.


Please use Tercen's products and services responsibly. Our products, services 
and our brand are really important to us, and we ask that you do not do anything 
that might damage them.

We expect data produced with Tercen's products to be represented transparently 
and honestly. Don't misrepresent data or metrics created by our products.
We expect you to use our products and services to help serve your customers. 
Don't re-sell, re-purpose or license, any data obtained from Tercen. Don't use 
our products to create a service that competes with Tercen or infringes our 
copyright. Keeping our customers' data secure is the most important thing that 
Tercen does. Don't use spiders, robots crawlers, data mining or similar tools 
to scrape the Tercen Website or APIs.

Tercen needs access to monitor your access to our API so don't block us from 
doing so. Respect our rate-limits. Don't overuse our APIs or resources â€“ we 
expect you to comply with any fair usage guidelines we publish from time to time.
If you have an idea as to how our products can be improved or you would like 
to try something experimental then please let us know and we'd be happy to 
discuss with you.

You can use our logo and branding where you have the right to do so, but please 
don't do anything that could damage our brand integrity or be misleading or 
confusing to customers - that includes using our logo in any part of your logo, 
using the Tercen name in your app name or anything else that could be considered 
an abuse of our branding, logos or copyrighted materials.

Treat your customers and their data responsibly.
Keeping our customers' data secure is the most important thing that Tercen does.
We go to considerable lengths to ensure that all data sent to Tercen is 
handled securely.

We expect others with access to our customers' data to treat it with the same 
level of trust and responsibility. 

Our terms for developers include:

* You must have appropriate measures in place to protect any information you 
receive from Tercen against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
* You must only use the data you need to build your product or service.
* You must have an end user agreement and a privacy policy in place with respect
to each of your customers - and it must be compatible with Tercen's terms.
* You must ensure you're meeting all your legal obligations in terms of 
applicable data protection and consumer protection; don't use Tercen's products 
in connection with data you don't have permission to process.
* You must be able to meet the requirements of the European Union's General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) for any data you process which falls within the 
scope of the legislation and fulfill subject access requests as required. In 
addition to breach notifications required under GDPR, you'll notify Tercen of 
any personal data breaches within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach.
* You must grant Tercen permission to audit your data processing activities. 
This can include independently produced audit reports.

As our developer platform and business evolves, so too will these guidelines. 
We'd love for you to get in touch if you've any feedback or suggestions for how
we can make them better.

We know that occasionally things can go wrong and mistakes can be made. If at
any time you are concerned that these guidelines may have been breached, please 
do notify us as soon as you become aware. These guidelines may change over time,
so do come back and check periodically.

Thanks for reading this far - we're excited to see what you'll build!
