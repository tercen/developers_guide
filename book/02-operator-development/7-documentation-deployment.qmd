# Documentation and Deployment

This chapter covers creating comprehensive documentation and deploying your operator to production. Building on the operator specifications from the previous chapter, you'll learn how to create user-friendly documentation and manage the deployment process. Good documentation is essential for user adoption, while proper deployment ensures reliability and maintainability.

## Documentation Best Practices

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for operator adoption and maintenance. Users need to understand what your operator does, how to use it, and how to interpret the results.

### README.md Structure

Your README should follow this proven structure:

```markdown
# [Operator Name]

[One-sentence description of what the operator does]

## Description

[Detailed explanation of the operator's purpose and computational approach]

This operator implements [specific algorithm/method] for [use case]. It is useful for:

- [Primary use case 1]
- [Primary use case 2]
- [Primary use case 3]

## Input Projection

- **Y-axis**: [Description of required y-axis data]
- **Row factors**: [How row factors are used]
- **Column factors**: [How column factors are used]
- **Color factors**: [Usage or "Not used"]
- **Label factors**: [Usage or "Not used"]

## Output

- **Output relation**: [Per cell/per row/per column/global]
- **Output columns**:
  - `column1`: [Description and data type]
  - `column2`: [Description and data type]
- **Data types**: [Summary of output data types]

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| param1 | Boolean | true | [Detailed description] |
| param2 | Double | 10 | [Detailed description] |

## Usage Example

[Step-by-step usage instructions with screenshots if helpful]

## Implementation Notes

[Important technical details, limitations, assumptions]

## References

[Academic references or links to relevant documentation]
```

## Dependency Management

Proper dependency management ensures your operator works reliably across different environments.

### R

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Using renv

```r
# In your operator's main directory, initialize renv
renv::init()

# Snapshot the environment
renv::snapshot()

# Your renv.lock file will be automatically created and should be committed
```

### Python Dependency Management

```bash
# Create requirements.txt with essential packages
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

:::

## Version Control Best Practices

### Git Workflow

Implement a clean git workflow for your operator development:

```bash
# Feature development workflow
git checkout -b feature/add-outlier-detection
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add outlier detection with IQR method"

# Create pull request for review
git push origin feature/add-outlier-detection

# After review and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/add-outlier-detection
```

### Semantic Versioning

Use semantic versioning for your releases:

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to operator interface
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Management

Create structured releases with proper documentation:

```bash
# Prepare release
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update version in operator.json
# Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

# Commit version changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release version 1.2.0"

# Create and push tag
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin main
git push origin v1.2.0
```

## Deployment Preparation

### Repository Structure Final Check

Ensure your complete operator repository has this structure:

```
your_operator_repository/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/          # CI/CD automation
├── main.R                  # Main operator implementation (R)
├── main.py                 # Main operator implementation (Python)
├── operator.json           # Operator metadata and parameters
├── README.md               # Comprehensive documentation
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── renv.lock              # R dependencies snapshot
└── test/                  # Test files and data (recommended)
    ├── input.csv
    ├── output.csv
    ├── test.json
    └── README.md
```
